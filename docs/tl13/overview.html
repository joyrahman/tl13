    TL13 Language Introduction</h1>

  <p>The TL13 programming language, is based on the P2K language used by 
  Michael Franz in his Advanced Compiler Construction class at the University
  of California, Irvine.  The P2K language was a simplified subset of
  Pascal, and TL13 has been simplified even further, so that you can
  experience writing an optimizing compiler without getting burdened by
  all of the complexities and details of a complete, standard programming
  language.</p>

  <p>Detailed Information is available on TL13's</p>

  <h2>Lexical Features</h2>
  <p>The TL13 language, is lexically simple.  All lexical items are
  to be separated by one or more whitespace characters (i.e., spaces, tabs, 
  and returns).  All identifiers
  start with an capital letter, and may contain only numbers and capital
  letters.  All key words are start with lower-case letters or are a symbol.  
  The symbols "(", ")", ":=", ";", "*", "div", "mod",
  "+", "-", "=", "!=", "<", "<=", ">", ">=" are used.</p>

  <h2>Data Types</h2>
  <p>Core TL13 supports 32-bit integers ("int"), booleans ("bool").  Variables
  are always declared to be of a particular type.


  <h2>Operators</h2>
  TL13 has several infix binary operators that work on either integer
  operands.  The multiplication "*", division "div", modulus "mod",
  addition "+", and subtraction "-" produce integer results.
  The comparison operators (i.e., equals "=", not equal "!=", less than
  "<", less-than or equal-to "<=", greater than ">", and greater-than
  or equal-to ">=") all produce boolean results.

  <h2>Control Structures</h2>
  <p>TL13 is a structured programming language.  The only control structures
  supported are "if" and "while" statements.  Both take a boolean expression
  that guards the body of the control structure.  In the case of an "if"
  statement, the statements after the "then" are executed if the expression
  is true, and the statements after the "else" (if there is one) are executed
  if the expression is false.  In the case of the "while" statement,
  the loop is exited if the expression false; otherwise if the
  expression is true, the body will be executed, and then the expression
  will be re-evaluated.</p>

  <h2>Assignment</h2>
  Assignments are a kind of statement rather than a kind of operator.
  The ":=" keyword is used to separate the left hand side (which is
  the variable being assigned to) from the right hand 
  side, which is an expression that must be of the same type as the
  left hand side.

  <h2>Built-in Procedures</h2>
  <p>Core TL13 does not support user-defined functions or procedures, but it
  does support one built-in procedures "writeInt" that
  outputs an integer and a new-line to the console (respectively), and
  one user-defined function, "readInt" that reads an integer 
  from the console.  The syntax for these is hard-coded into TL13's
  BNF grammar.

  <p>You are encouraged to post additional TL13 programs (or not-quite
    TL13 programs) to the Piazza forum.</p>
