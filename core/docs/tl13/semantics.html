  Informal Semantics</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Only those variables which have been declared can be assigned
      to or used.
      <ul>
      <li>All int variables and array elements are considered to have
      initial values of "0".
      <li>All bool variables are considered to have initial values of "false".
      </ul>
    <li>All binary operators operate on signed integer operands:
      <ul>
      <li>"x * y" results in the product of x and y.
      <li>"x div y" which results in the integer quotient of x divided by y.
        The behavior is not defined if y is 0 or 
        if x is the smallest 32-bit negative integer and y is -1.
      <li>"x mod y" is the results in the remainder of x divided by y
        when x is non-negative and y is positive.  Otherwise, the result
        is undefined.
      <li>"x + y" results in the sum of x and y.
      <li>"x - y" is the difference of y subtracted from x.
      <li>"x = y" is true if x and y are the same, otherwise it is false.
      <li>"x != y" is false if x and y are the same, otherwise it is true.
      <li>"x < y" is true if x is less than y, otherwise it is false.
      <li>"x > y" is true if x is greater than y, otherwise it is false.
      <li>"x <= y" is true if x is less than or equal to y, otherwise it is false.
      <li>"x >= y" is true if x is greater than or equal to y, otherwise it is false.
      <li>Computations should be done using integers using a
        32-bit 2's complement representation.  Overflowing computations 
        should simply "wrap around".
   </ul>
   <li>"if" statements evaluate their expression, if the expression is true,
     then the "then-statements" are executed, if it is fales, the
     "else-statements" are executed.
   <li>"while" statements first evaluates its expression.  If it is false,
     execution continues after the end of the "while" statement. If
     it is true, the statements in the body of the "while" loop are
     executed.  After they finish executing, the expression is
     re-evaluated.  As long as the expression is true, the process
     repeats itself, alternatively evaluating the expression and
     executing the statements in the body.  Once the expression is false,
     execution continues after the end of the "while" loop.
   <li>"writeInt" evaluates its expression and outputs the result to the console
     and causes the cursor to move to the beginning of the next line.
   <li>"readInt" reads an integer from the console and updates an integer
     variable to hold that value.
  </ul>


  <h2>Errata/Clarifications</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>10/2/13: Increased the situations under which multiplication and
      division are undefined.
