  <h1><a href="index.html">CS 5363: TL13 Compiler Project</a>, Final Submission</h1>

  <p>Deadline: 5pm, Saturday, December 7, 2013<br />
  </p>

  <h2>Final Project Submission</h2>
  <p>In the previous phase of the project you have completed a 
    non-optimizing compiler for the core TL13 language that can
    produce semantically equivalent MIPS assembly code.  
  </p>
  <p>For the final submission deadline, you may <strong>either</strong>:</p>
    <ol>
      <li />continue to work on your compiler and submit it for
        regrading by December 7, <strong>or</strong>
      <li />choose to implement <strong>one</strong> of the 
        language or optimization extensions listed below.
    </ol>

  <h2>Option 1: Resubmission of Core</h2>
  <p>If you choose the former, your will receive a new score (out of
    300 points) for the entire core compiler that (if higher) will 
    replace your Review I, Review II, Review III, and Review IV 
    scores.</p>
  <p>In determining whether your final course grade is at
    least a 'B', your overall course score will be computed as if 
    you had received 50/50 points on the extension.  In determining 
    whether your final course grade is at least an 'A', your score 
    will be computed as if you had received 0/50 points on the extension.
  </p>
    

  <h2>Option 2: TL13 Language Extension or Compiler Optimization</h2>
  <p>If you choose not to resubmit your core, 
    you have the opportunity to earn 50 points towards 
    an 'A' by extending your compiler to support an additional 
    language feature OR an add additional optimizations.  
    ('B' grades will be determined as if you earned 50 points
    on the extensions regardless of whether / how well you do 
    on the extensions.) Some of the extensions may also include 
    "bonus" options that allow you to earn more than 50 points.
  </p>
  <p>
    This phase is intentionally less tightly specified and
    more open ended than those of Parser and Core.  Below is
    a list of possible extensions and the amount of points that
    can be earned by successfully completing each extensions.
    <strong>In you blackboard cover letter, be sure to include all
    items listed in the submission instructions there.  Make sure
    that this cover letter clearly indicates which extension you 
    attempted, its status, any "bonus" items included
    in your code, and a list of any relevant items included in the 
    <code>docs</code> directory.</strong>
  </p>

  <h3>Extensions</h3>

  <h4>Language Extensions</h4>

  Create a revised language description (including lexical categories,
  context-free grammar, informal type rules, and informal semantics---as
  appropriate) containing one or more of the following language extensions.  
  Implement the features so that the compiler in the "extensions" folder
  can correctly compile the revised language.  Create a test plan describing
  how the language extensions will be tested, what test cases will be used,
  and what the result of the testing is.

  <ol>
    <li/>Support two of the following types: arrays, ML/Scala-style lists, and 
       ML-style <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_ML#Algebraic_datatypes_and_pattern_matching">algebraic data types</a>
      <ul>
      <li/>Bonus: all three of these (including arbitrary combinations)
      <li/>Bonus: "foreach" loops
      <li/>Bonus: pattern-matching case statements
      </ul>

    <li/>Support for recursive procedures.
      <ul>
      <li/>Bonus: support for nesting with static scoping
      <li/>Bonus: support for procedure variables and parameters
      </ul>
  </ol>

  <h4>Optimizations and Compiler Extensions</h4>
  Below is a list of transformations and optimizations that can
  be implemented in your compiler project for additional credit. 
  In addition to implementing the code as a pass over the ILOC
  representation, you should
  provide a description of the algorithm used (with citations if appropriate),
  and a description of the testing done (including test inputs and outputs 
  checked).
  

  <ol>
    <li><p>SSA-based optimization phase on the ILOC intermediate representation,
         including translation into (and out of) SSA form using one of the 
         following algorithms :
      <ul>
        <li>The simplest method is probably to follow <a 
         href="http://link.springer.com.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/chapter/10.1007%2F3-540-46423-9_8">the 
         approach of Aycock and Horspool</a>.
         The method described in this paper is similar to what is
         described in Cooper 9.3.1, but if you are going to implement
         it, read the paper.
        <li>Alternatively, you may use the algorithm in Cooper 9.3.3/9.3.4.
        <li>The seminal work on SSA construction is <a 
         href="http://doi.acm.org.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/10.1145/115372.115320">that of Cytron</a>.
        <li>There's also a <a href="http://doi.acm.org.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/10.1145/1065887.1065890">a 
            newer algorithm</a> by Das and Ramakrishna that may be worth 
            considering.
      </ul>
      <p>Translation out of SSA form should pay careful attention to semantics
      of the &phi;-functions, especially their "simultaneous" execution, which
      leads to the swap problem (Cooper 9.3.5).  Morgan's "Building an 
      Optimizing Compiler" has a detailed algorithm for handling this.  
      Contact the instructor if you're interested.  Some of these issue
      only show up when optimizations are performed in SSA form.
      </p>
    <ul>
    <li><p>Bonus: Implement <a href="http://dx.doi.org.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/10.1002/(SICI)1097-024X(199706)27:6%3C701::AID-SPE104%3E3.0.CO;2-0">SSA/dominator-based value numbering</a></p>

    <li><p>Bonus: Implement constant propagation/folding using the SSA-based 
             algorithm in Cooper Section 9.3.6

    <li><p>Bonus: useless code elimination using the algorithm 
        in Cooper Section 10.2.1 and/or useless control flow elimination from
        Cooper 10.2.2.<br />
        As a simplification, instead of marking jumps based on the RDF of
          marked instructions (the last for loop in Figure 10.1(a)), 
          you may instead consider all jumps/branches to be critical.
       [Note: even though SSA isn't needed for useless control flow 
       elimination, you can only earn points for it if you also do SSA.]</p>
        </p>

    <li><p>Bonus: unreachable code elimination in Cooper Section 10.2.3<br/>
       To implement this, you will need to extend the language with an
       "exit/return" statement that terminates program execution completely.
       [Note: even though this isn't SSA-based, you can only earn points
       for it if you also do SSA.]</p>
    </ul>


    <li><p>implement Chaitin-Briggs register allocation with live range analysis
      and interference graph coloring 
      (Cooper Section 13.4.1, 13.4.3, 13.4.5)</p>
      <ul>
        <li/>Bonus: no reserved spill registers
        <li/>Bonus: coallescing
        <li/>Bonus: live-range splitting
      </ul>
  </ol>

  <h3>Grading Criteria</h3>

  <p>The grade for a student's extension will be assessed
  according to the following rubric:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>50 points: 
      Core and Extension code has no significant flaws.  Students are 
      responsible for demonstrating evidence of this by having adequate testing
      that the code works correctly or nearly correctly for nearly
      all test cases.  TA/instructor test cases and code inspection
      may also be used in assessment.
    <li>40 points: 
      Core compiler functioned correctly on the "real programs".
      Extension code has minor flaws, but correctly handles the 
       "common cases".  
      Students are responsible for demonstrating evidence of this by 
      having adequate testing and showing that the code implements
      the documented extensions.
      TA/instructor test cases and code inspection may also be used 
      in assessment.
    <li>20 points: 
      Core compiler functioned correclty on the "real programs".
      Extension code is incomplete or has major flaws, but the extension
      have been documented (as described above) and the submission
      includes at least two non-trivial test cases that shows the
      extension working.
  </ul>

  <p>Up to 50 additonal points may be awarded, at the discretion of the
  instructional staff, for extensions that go beyond the minimum requirements
  listed.  (Suggested "bonus" items are listed for most extensions.)

  <strong><p>No points will be awarded for any extensions unless the 
  extension code is submitted according to the instructions and the core
  compiler works correctly.</strong>  The core compiler will be considered 
  to work correctly if it... </p>
  <ul>
   <li>builds according to the build instructions, and
   <li>produces executing SPIM code for 
     <a href="language/overview.html#examples">all provided test programs</a>, and
   <li>produces correctly executing SPIM code for nearly all of the provided
     test programs in each category, especially 
     the "real" programs.
  </ul>

  <h3>Submission Mechanics and Packaging</h3>
  <p>Please refer to the <a href="getting-started.html">the
  getting started</a> for information on how to prepare the
  git commit containing your source code for grading.

  <h2 id="samples">Testing</h2>
  <p>You are also required to adequately test your compiler optimizations
  and language extensions.  Please submit
  your test cases along with your source code and document the
  current state of your compiler based on your own testing.
  In your documentation for each extensions, please include
  a description of which test cases you developed to specifically
  test those extensions.</p>

  <p>Hint: if you implement multiple optimization SSA optimizations,
  it is advisable to include a command-line switch that 
  activates/deactivates individual optimizations when feasible.
  This will allow, for example, full points to be assigned for 
  "optimization 1" even if "optimization 2" crashes for some
  test cases. Otherwise, you may lose points for "optimization 1"
  because "optimization 2" breaks a test case.
  </p>

  <h2>Errata/Clarifications</h2>

  <p>There may need to be corrections, clarifications, or other modifications 
  to these instructions, you are responsible for monitoring the class web 
  site and listening during lecture for announcements related to this 
  assignment.</p>
