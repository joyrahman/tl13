  <h2 id="software">Software</h2>
  <p>In order to do your assignments you will need to have:
  </p>
    <ul>
      <li>g++ (4.6.3), Java JDK (version 7), Mono (v2.10.8.1), or Scala (2.9.1)
      <li>a git client
      <li>graphviz
      <li>SPIM (v8.0)
    </ul>
  <p>You may also find it useful to use an IDE, such as 
    <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> (perhaps, 
    with egit and Scala IDE) or MonoDevelop,
    and an interactive graphviz dot file viewer, such as <a
    href="http://zvtm.sourceforge.net/zgrviewer.html">zgrviewer</a>
    or the Zest plugin for Eclipse.
  </p>

  <p>These can be installed under Linux, OS X, or Windows, but the versions 
   of this software is included in the virtual machine provided by
   the instructor.  We will be using the versions of these tools provided 
   on the virtual machine for grading, and your grade may be reduced if you use
   newer language features that are not supported by these versions of the tools.  
   Generally, using older versions than those listed above should not 
   cause problems. </p>

  <h2 id="git">Git / GitHub</h2>

  <p>Each student has been setup, so that they have access to a private
    repository within the UTSA-CS-5363-Fall2013 organization on GitHub.
    At each deadline, you will need to submit your by pushing a
    branch containing your submission to GitHub.  You must also 
    submit a cover letter to Blackboard as described 
    <a href="#documentation">below.</a> 
  </p>

  <p><strong>This will be most easily accomplished if you set up git to
    manage your source code when you begin develop it, and push to the
    repository on GitHub periodically.  If you try to copy your code into 
    git right before the deadline, you are likely to run into problems
    and may not get your hard-work turned in on time.</strong></p>

  <p>You should not overwrite (with a forced push) the branch containing
    your submission on GitHub until your work has been graded.  (You may, 
    however, continue to use normal appending pushes.)</p>

  <h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>
  Prior to each submission deadline, you should prepare a cover letter
  that you submit (as text rather than as an attachment) through blackboard.

  Your cover letter should contain:
  <ol>
   <li>Your full name.
   <li>Your myUTSA id.
   <li>Your GitHub Account Name.
   <li>The SHA-1 code of the commit you would like to be graded.
   <li>Which programming language was used to implement the compiler.
   <li>Approximately how many hours you spent on your compiler 
       (since the last review date).
   <li>Grading requests (if applicable).  Indicate if you would like your 
     parser to be graded using the parse tree (.pt.dot) or AST output (.ast.dot).  
     Indicate if your CFG is incomplete, and you would like your iloc be graded 
     based on textual output (.iloc.txt) instead of the ILOC code embedded in the
     control flow graph (.iloc.cfg.dot).
   <li>A summary of the current state of a compiler: 
       <ul>
         <li>How complete is your compiler? (i.e., Does it produce 
           parse tree, AST/types, ILOC/CFG, MIPS assembly?  Does 
           it work for the whole TL13 language or only parts of it?)
         <li>known bugs (i.e., Does it fail to compile? Does it
           produce any compiler warnings?  Are there any test 
           programs that crash the compiler or for which the compiler 
           produces incorrect output?)
       </ul>
   <li>A summary of how you have tested your compiler.
   <li>Instructions for how to build and run your compiler
     (Regardless of what you put here, the language-specific 
     requirements below apply.).
   <li>List any resources that you used in completing this assignment 
     besides the instructor, TA, the course text books, and the class 
     piazza forum.
   <li>The statement that "This submission is my own work. I did not look
     at any one else's compiler code.  All resources used have been fully 
     disclosed above." unless this statement is untrue, in which
     case you must completely disclose the extent to which the work is
     not your independent submission and request an appointment with the
     instructor to discuss the situation.
   <li>The statement that "I have not and will not share this code with
     other 5363 students." unless this statement is untrue,
     in which case you must completely disclose the extent to which you
     showed your code to others and request an appointment with the instructor
     to discuss the situation.
  </ol>

  <h2 id="directories">Directory Tree</h2>
  <p>In order for the instructor and TA to efficiently grade the
  assignments, it is necessary that we place some specific instructions
  on how your source code and other files are organized in the git commit tree
  so that we can compile and run that code in an efficient way.  </p>

<pre>
|
+- .gitignore       [highly recommended, should list specifications for compiler generated files that should be ignored by git]
+- README.md        [optional]
+- warmup           [optional]
+- core
   |
   +- .classpath    [eclipse path for compiling files; optional]
   +- .project      [eclipse project file; optional]
   +- .settings     [eclipse project settings; optional]
   +- LANGUAGE.txt
   +- bin/          [must be empty; optional]
   +- src/          [source code]
   +- tests/        [test cases used]
   +- docs/         [any additional documentation if needed; optional]
</pre>

  <p>The git commit tree should contain a directory named core:
  <code>LANGUAGE.txt</code>
  (that contains a single line with the word "Java",
  "C++", "Scala", or "Mono" corresponding to your chosen implementation language),
  a <code>tests</code> directory (containing the TL13 programs you
  used to test your compiler) and a <code>src</code> directory (containing
  the source code for your parser).
  </p>

  <p>You should avoid staging/committing with git all object files, class files, 
  executables, or your compiler's output files.  (These may reside
  in your local working directory, but they should not be staged/committed.)
  Correct this by removing the files with (git rm) and adding the files to
  .gitignore (or doing the GUI equivalent) as soon as possible.
  </p>

  <p>Note: git only versions files and not directories.  This means that
    it will not allow you to stage an empty bin directory.  You may
    either leave it empty or include a single place-holder file.  (Such 
    as an empty file .gitkeep file or a .gitignore file containing 
    "*.class".)</p>

  <h2 id="languages">Additional Build/Invocation/Layout Instructions by Implementation Language</h2>

  <h3>Java</h3>
  <p>If you are implementing your compiler in Java...
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>The core/src directory should contain the Java source files in
      directories matching the Java package.
    <li>The main method for each phase should be placed in the class 
      edu.utsa.tl13.Compiler which would be stored in the file
      under <code>src/edu/utsa/tl13/Compiler.java</code>.
    <li>From within the <code>core</code> directory of the git checkout
      your TL13 compiler should be able to be compiled using the command:
      <code>javac -d bin -sourcepath src src/edu/utsa/tl13/Compiler.java</code>
    <li>The main method of the Compiler class, should expect a parameter
      specifying the input TL13 filename (ending in <code>.tl13</code>).  
      The names of the output files should be automatically derived 
      from the input file name by extending the base input file name with
      a new suffix denoting the contents and type as described in the
      assignment's output specification.
    <ol>
      <li>For examples, from within your <code>core</code> directory, you 
        should be able to use your TL13 compiler to compile the TL13 file 
        simple.tl13 in the <code>path-to-test-cases</code> directory with 
        the command:
      <code>java -classpath bin edu.utsa.tl13.Compiler path-to-test-cases/simple1.tl13</code>
      <li>In this case, the parser output would be stored in 
        <code>path-to-test-cases/simple.pt.dot</code> (relative to the 
        directory from which the command was run).
    </ol>
  </ol>

  <h3>C++</h3>
  <p>If you are implementing your compiler in C++...
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>The core/src directory should contain the C++ source files
      (ending in <code>.cc</code> and header files (ending in <code>.hh</code>).
    <li>From within the core directory,
      your TL13 compiler should be able to be compiled using the command:
<pre>
g++ -o bin/tl13 -Wall `find src -name '*.cc'` -lboost_regex 
</pre>  
    <li>The main function, should expect a parameter
      specifying the input TL13 filename (ending in <code>.tl13</code>).  
      The names of the output files should be automatically derived 
      from the input file name by extending the base input file name with
      a new suffix denoting the contents and type as described in the
      assignment's output specification.
    <ol>
      <li>For examples, you 
        should be able to use your TL13 compiler to compile the TL13 file 
        simple.tl13 in the <code>path-to-test-cases</code> directory with the command:
      <code>bin/tl13 path-to-test-cases/simple.tl13</code>
      <li>In this case, the parse tree output would be stored in 
        <code>path-to-test-cases/simple.pt.dot</code>.
    </ol>
  </ol>

  <h3>Scala</h3>
  <p>If you are implementing your compiler in Scala...
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>The src directory should contain the Scala source files
      (ending in <code>.scala</code>.
    <li>From within the core directory,
      your TL13 compiler should be able to be compiled using the command:
<pre>
scalac -d bin `find src -name '*.scala'`
</pre>  
    <li>The Compiler should be able to be started using the main method
      of the edu.utsa.tl13.Compiler class.  This main method should expect a parameter
      specifying the input TL13 filename (ending in <code>.tl13</code>).  
      The names of the output files should be automatically derived 
      from the input file name by extending the base input file name with
      a new suffix denoting the contents and type as described in the
      assignment's output specification.
    <ol>
      <li>For examples, from within the <code>core</code> directory, you 
        should be able to use your TL13 compiler to compile the TL13 file 
        simple.tl13 in the <code>path-to-test-cases</code> directory with 
        the command:
      <code>scala -classpath bin edu.utsa.tl13.Compiler path-to-test-cases/simple.tl13</code>
      <li>In this case, the parse tree output would be stored in 
        <code>path-to-test-cases/simple.pt.dot</code>.
    </ol>
  </ol>

  <h3>C# (Mono)  [Experimental--Instructions subject to revision.]</h3>
  <p>If you are implementing your compiler in C#...
  <ol>
    <li>It must compile and run under Mono v2.10.8.1 using dmcs (which targets mscorelib 4.0).

      (ending in <code>.cs</code>).
    <li>From within the core directory,
      your TL13 compiler should be able to be compiled using the command:
<pre>
dmcs -o:bin/tl13.exe -main:utsa.tl13.Compiler `find src -name '*.cs'`
</pre>  
    <li>The Compiler should be able to be started using the main method
      of the edu.utsa.tl13.Compiler class.  This main method should expect a parameter
      specifying the input TL13 filename (ending in <code>.tl13</code>).  
      The names of the output files should be automatically derived 
      from the input file name by extending the base input file name with
      a new suffix denoting the contents and type as described in the
      assignment's output specification.
    <ol>
      <li>For examples, from within the <code>core</code> directory, you 
        should be able to use your TL13 compiler to compile the TL13 file 
        simple.tl13 in the <code>path-to-test-cases</code> directory with 
        the command:
      <code>mono bin/tl13.exe path-to-test-cases/simple.tl13</code>
      <li>In this case, the parse tree output would be stored in 
        <code>path-to-test-cases/simple.pt.dot</code>.
