  <h1><a href="index.html">CS 5363: TL13 Compiler Project</a>, Core Compiler</h1>

  <p>For the core compiler project, you will complete a non-optimizing compiler
    for the TL13 language.  The resulting compiler should translate
    TL13 source code, producing output at several intermediate stages, into
    MIPS assembly code executable in the SPIM simulator.</p>

  <p>Make sure you pay attention to the requirements listed under
    <a="#output">Input/Output specification</a> below.  Programs
    must comply with those specifications to receive full credit.
  </p>

  <h3>Recursive Descent Parser</h3>
  <p>Your first assignment is to write a Scanner and Parser for the TL13
  language.  A BNF grammar and a list of lexical items for the TL13
  language is provided.  If you wish, you may use an automated tool,
  such as lex, to create the code for your scanner, but since everything
  is separated by whitespace, you may
  find that for TL13 it is simpler to write an ad-hoc scanner by hand
  or using standard Java library calls (hint: look at the methods
  provided by java.lang.String).</p>

  <p>The TL13 language is intended to be LL(1), and you are required to write,
  "by hand," a <strong>predictive recursive-descent top-down parser</strong>
  for it.  You may modify the grammar to make it LL(1).
  Your parser should have one method or function corresponding to
  each non-terminal in the language's (modified) grammar.</p>

  <p>For a lexically or syntactically invalid program, your scanner or
  parser should output an appropriate error message.</p>

  <p>
  For a syntactically valid input program, the your parser should
  output a <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">Graphviz DOT file</a>
  containing either the program's parse tree or the program's AST (as
  required in the next step).
  </p>


  <h3>Abstract Syntax Tree Generation</h3>
  <p>You should modify your parser to produce an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) as
     a tree data structure in memory. <strong>It is a requirement that you
     create the abstract syntax tree as a tree data structure in memory.  You
     will not receive full credit.</strong>
  </p>
  
    <p>Note: you do not want to generate your AST by first generating
      the parse tree and then deleting nodes.  You want to create
      the AST directly and inductively during the recursive descent parsing.</p>
  
    <p>Hint: If you are using Java, you may find it useful to provide a 
      <a href="http://objectmentor.com/resources/articles/visitor.pdf">Visitor</a>
      interface for processing the different subclasses of AST nodes
      in the in-memroy data structure.  
      (In this case, one Visitor might be for printing out graphviz nodes
      for AST Nodes.  Another might be for decorating the AST with types
      and doing type checking.)  If you are using Scala, you will find
      that pattern matching provides the same organization, but is much
      more concise.
    </p>

  <h3>Type Checking and Type Annotated AST</h3>
    <p>Once you have generated the AST. The compiler should traverse the
    AST to find the type of each subexpression and determine whether there
    are any violations of the <a href="language/types.html">TL13 type 
    rules</a>.</p>

    <p>Hints:
    In order to type check the program, you will need to create a symbol
    table to associate each appearance of a variable with that variables
    declared type. The best way to do this, is probably to create an entry
    in a hash table indexed by name and containing information about
    each declared entity. (For TL13, it is sufficient to just track
    the name and type of each declared variable.) And then when the AST
    generation code comes across a variable in a procedure body, it can
    look that name up in the symbol table and store a pointer/reference
    to that symbol table entry in the AST node.
    </p>

  <h3>Three Address Code Generation</h3>
    <p>The compiler should traverse the abstract syntax tree and 
    translate the program into basic blocks of three-address ILOC 
    instructions [Section 5.3.2, Section 5.3.3, and Appendix A of 
    Cooper] according
    to the <a href="language/semantics.html">TL13 semantics</a>. You may 
    add instructions beyond those described in Cooper.  Specifically,
    you may wish to add mod, readInt, and writeInt instructions. As in the 
    examples found in Cooper, each basic block
    should end in a conditional branch or unconditional branch (a.k.a.,
    jump).  The ILOC code can use an infinite number of virtual registers.
    </p>

    <p>Hints:</p>
    <ul>
    <li> It is suggested that you get the CFG output (see below)
      working as early as possible to aid in testing and debugging.
    <li>
    In order to be able to produce the appropriate CFG output and
    translate into MIPS assembly code, you will probably want to
    have a class representing blocks (encapsulating a list of instructions
    and providing operations to iterate over that list and to access
    the successor blocks) and also a class representing each instruction
    with fields for each of the three "addresses" as well as the opcode.
    </ul>
   

  <h3>MIPS Assembly Output</h3>
   <p>As the last step, the "back end" of the compiler should translate 
   the program into executable MIPS assembly code.  This involves
   selecting the appropriate MIPS assembly language instructions,
   modifying the code so that it executes with a finite number of
   registers, and outputting an ASCII file containing MIPS assembly
   code that is executable with SPIM.</p>

  <p>The ILOC and MIPS instruction sets are quite similar, and depending on
  the subset of ILOC which the IR contains, instruction selection may be done 
  through a simple 1:1 substitution of MIPS instructions for ILOC instructions.
  (Please refer to <a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~larus/HP_AppA.pdf">Appendix
  A of Computer Organization and Design: The Hardware/Software Interface</a>
  for a description of the MIPS Instruction Set Architecture (ISA), the MIPS
  assembly language, and the SPIM simulator.)
  It may be necessary, however, to handle some instructions in a slightly
  more complicated manner.  (For example, the MIPS load-from-memory 
  instruction takes a "register + a 16 bit constant offset" as its address, and
  it is not possible to map ILOC's loadAO instruction directly to it.)
  Note: SPIM provides simulated system calls for printing out characters;
  you may find the <em>read_int</em>, <em>print_int</em>, and 
  <em>print_char</em> system calls useful for implementing TL13's
  <em>readInt</em> and <em>writeInt</em> operations.
  You may wish to use an instruction selection scheme based on the peephole 
  optimization to handle these cases.  (Cf. Section 11.4 of Engineering
  a Compiler, but you can probably simplify the scheme described there.)
  </p>

  <p>In order to generate executable MIPS code, however, you will have to
  generate code that uses only those registers available in the MIPS
  ISA.  Normally this would be done using graph-coloring register allocator 
  with spilling; implementing this will be an extension.
  In order to get executable code without a register allocator, you can 
  add a "dummy register allocator pass" that simply sets aside dedicated 
  registers for the input and output of each MIPS instruction, and 
  creates one global variable (in the ".data" segment or as an offset from
  the frame pointer) for each IR temporary.  You would then place a
  store instruction to write to that global variable, each time it the
  temporary is assigned to, and place load instructions to transfer the
  data back from the global variables into the dedicated registers for
  each MIPS instruction.  This implementation would be quite inefficient,
  but it will produce correct code.  See the <a href="#simple1">simple1.s</a> as an example of the output this process 
  would produce.  (An alternative, which you may
  also pursue would be to only use a limited set of registers in the 
  ILOC code and to instead assign a fixed memory location to each
  variable/temporary and perform loads/stores as appropriate in
  the ILOC code.)  
  </p>

  <h2>Input/Output Specification</h2>
  <p>The compiler program should expect a TL13 input file, 
  <code><em>&lt;basename&gt;</em>.tl13</code>, to be specified as 
  command-line argument when it is invoked.  (See language-specific 
  submission instructions in the <a href="getting-stated.html">getting
  stated document</a> for details.)
  </p>

  <p>If the input file is not a syntactically-valid program (i.e., if the 
  program contains a lexical element that is not a legal token or does 
  not match the BNF grammar), the compiler should ouptut an error message 
  to standard error (System.err in Java) containing the text 
  "SCANNER ERROR", the text "PARSER ERROR", or the text "SYNTAX ERROR".
  (There is no constraint on which you use.  The intent is that you
  might want to distinguish between scanner and parser errors or you 
  might want to just call everything a syntax error.)
  </p>

  <p>The compiler may optionally, output a parse tree in graphviz dot 
  format to the file: <code><em>&lt;basename&gt;</em>.pt.dot</code><br />
  (The output requirements of the "Recursive Descent Parser" item in the 
  rubric may be satisfied with this parse tree or by an AST meeting the
  requirements in the next section.)
  </p>

  <p>If there is no syntax error, the compiler should output an abstract
  syntax tree in graphviz dot format to the AST output file, 
  <code><em>&lt;basename&gt;</em>.ast.dot</code>.  The nodes of the abstract
  syntax tree that serve as the roots of subexpressions whose type is INT
  should have a fillcolor of <code>"/pastel13/3"</code> (a light green) 
  and those whose type is BOOL should have a fillcolor of
  <code>"/pastel13/2"</code> (a light blue).  If there is a type error, the
  compiler should output an error message to standard error that contains
  the text "TYPE ERROR" and should also color the AST 
  node associated with that type error (e.g., the node of an operation whose
  operands have incorrect types) <code>"/pastel13/1"</code> 
  (a pink) in the AST output file.
  </p>

  <p>If there is no syntax or type error, the compiler should also output
  a control flow graph in graphviz dot format to the file,
  <code><em>&lt;basename&gt;</em>.iloc.cfg.dot</code>.  The control flow graph
  should be based on a translation of the original program into an ILOC
  three-address code.  The nodes in the graph should be the basic blocks
  of the ILOC program representation.  In the graphviz output, each of 
  the nodes of the graph should be labeled with the instructions found
  in that basic block.  (Optionally, one may also create a text file
  <code><em>&lt;basename&gt;</em>.iloc.txt</code> containing just the iloc
  instructions, so that they can be evaluated even if the control flow
  graph output does not work correctly.)
  </p>

  <p>The final output of the compiler, 
  <a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~larus/spim.html">SPIM-compatible</a> MIPS 
  assembly code that faithfully implements the semantics of
  the original source program, should be written to the file,
  <code><em>&lt;basename&gt;</em>.s</code>.  

  <p>So for a correct TL13 source program,
  <code><em>&lt;basename&gt;</em>.tl13</code>, the compiler should produce
  a Type-annotated Abstract Syntax Tree 
  (<code><em>&lt;basename&gt;</em>.ast.dot</code>), a control flow graph
  (<code><em>&lt;basename&gt;</em>.iloc.cfg.dot</code>), and a MIPS assembly
  code file (<code><em>&lt;basename&gt;</em>.s</code>).  Optionally,
  it may also produce a parse tree, 
  <code><em>&lt;basename&gt;</em>.pt.dot</code>.


  <h2>Progress at Review Dates</h2>
  <p>The entire compiler should be complete and operating correctly by
  the final deadline.  "Rough drafts" of the compiler are due at three
  intermediate deadlines: "Review 1", "Review 2", and "Review 3".  
  These deadlines exist to encourage students to make timely progress and to provide
  an opportunity for the TA and/or instructor to review the code and
  provide feedback.  To receive full-credt, students should aim to have 
  at least parsing and parse-tree output completed by "Review I";
  additionally have AST generation, type checking, and AST output
  completed by "Review II"; and additionally have ILOC translation
  and CFG output completed by "Review III".
  </p>

  <h3>Grading Criteria</h3>
  <p>Please refer to the Grading Rubric available in blackboard.


  <h3>Submission Mechanics and Packaging</h3>
  The <a href="getting-started.html">"Getting Started" document</a>
  contains requirements about how your program should be documented,
  be able to be built, be able to be invoked, and submitted using
  git.</p>

  <h2 id="samples">Testing and Sample Inputs and Outputs</h2>
  <p>You are also required to adequately test your compiler and submit
  your test cases along with your source code and document the
  current state of your compiler based on your own testing.  Include
  both incorrectly-typed programs and correctly-typed programs that
  exercise all parts of your compiler.</p>

  <p>The following some sample input TL13 programs 
    and (for some) their corresponding output files.
    Nota bene: it is not necessary to match the text of the dot files
    exactly.  It is only necessary to produce dot files that visually
    complies with the specification above when rendered with graphviz.
    For MIPS, it is only necessary to produce programs that behave
    in accordance with the TL13 semantics when executed.

  <h2>Errata/Clarifications</h2>

  <p>There may need to be corrections, clarifications, or other modifications 
  to these instructions, you are responsible for monitoring the class web 
  site and listening during lecture for announcements related to this 
  assignment.</p>

  <ul>
    <li/>9/23/2013: Included accidentally omitted parse tree outputs.
    <li/>9/23/2013: Fixed reference to bzr instead of git.  Fixed reference
       to "two" instead of "three" intermediate deadlines.
    <li/>10/3/2013: Updated sample MIPS output.
    <li/>10/21/2013: In the ILOC code your compiler produces, you may make
       use of additional instructions that you invent yourself as long as 
       (1) they do not duplicate existing instructions (e.g., if you are doing
       addition, you should use the existing addition instructions rather than
       inventing new ones), and (2) you include a documents in your docs 
       directory describing the syntax and meanining of these additional 
       instructions.
    <li/>11/13/2013: Updated sample MIPS output.  Looks like I uploaded the
       wrong version on 10/3/2013.  This should be more logical.
